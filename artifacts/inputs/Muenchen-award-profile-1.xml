        <paragraph>Edmund F. Muenchen, Cincinnati furniture salesman, parish Holy Name officer, fraternal and civic club member, occasional bowler, devoted husband and father, awoke one morning last year and found himself famous.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With his wife, Hilda, he received the accolade of Xavier university and parish pride when he was designated head of the "American Family of the Year from Metropolitan Cincinnati."</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Last week, when he completed plans for this year's conference (May 12-16) and for the selection of another family of the year, Edmund Muenchen still found the events of a year ago hard to credit.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>"The award was a very great honor," he said at his home. "And the way it came about was a great surprise, too. We were there when we began receiving letters from all over the country complimenting us on our wonderful family."</paragraph>
